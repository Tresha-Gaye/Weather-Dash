# Weather-Dash

This application uses a server-side API - OPEN weather to create a responsive, dymanic Work Day Scheduler.

View the deployed application by [clicking this link](https://tresha-gaye.github.io/[deployed-app-name]/).

**Criteria and Accomplishment**

- the app is required to display the current dat at the top of the calendar. I added functionality to dynamically update the time every second because otherwise the time only changes when the page is refreshed. 
- the app should include timeblocks for standard business hours (9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), which are color coded to indicate whether the timwblock is in the past, present or future.
- the app features the ability to enter tasks/events in an input field, which can then be saved in local storage adn be available after the page is refreshed.

Below is a screenshots of the app showing the functionality:
